Concept of Tech Responsive Elements - Cells  
This elements can have four different shapes, and have sizes that are snapped to the grid.  
They are dinamically created and dynamically sorted based on order priority.  

Although it can be manually adjusted, e.g. application requires to have high priority to some elements, and they are more then just an image, but a dynamic content.  
Using pattern with "plugins" each element can have own css, js and other stuff and be absolutelly unique type.  
E.g. some of them are links, some of them contain text with sliding panel, some of them tweets, some lighbox image, and any others.
